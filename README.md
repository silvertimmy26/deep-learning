# Deep Learning Challenge: Alphabet Soup Charity
# Author: Matthew Adent

This project builds a deep learning binary classification model to help Alphabet Soup identify whether funding applicants are likely to be successful. The model is trained on a dataset of over 34,000 historical applications. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and multiple optimization attempts using TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.

Although the final model did not exceed the 75% accuracy target, three optimization attempts were completed. :(
